# Coding Discussion 01

## Instructions 

For this discussion, please do the following: 

- Clone the class Github repository `coding_discussions_ppol564_fall2019`.
- There are two specific tasks to complete in this coding discussion: 
	1. In the first task, you'll find a `.txt` file entitled: `first_collaboration.txt` in the `Task01/` folder. In the file, write your full name plus (a) a sentence/paragraph regarding why you chose to come to public policy school and what aspect of public policy interests you most, (b) a sentence regarding one thing new you learned in class this week that you did not previously know. Each of these points should occupy a new line.

	```
	John Doe
	a. I decided to come to a public policy school because...
	b. I learned...
	```

	2. Create a Jupyter Notebook in the `Task02/` folder. Retitle the notebook with your lastname_firstname_netid (`doe_john_jd568.ipynb`). In a code chunk, load and run the code located in `script01.py`. In a different code chunk, load and run the code located in `script02.py`. In seperate code chunks, compare the run times of the two functions contained within each file (there is only one function per script). Note that the code to run when timing the function has been provided in the script. Finally, in a markdown chunk write up which function appears to run faster.

## Response

You only need to respond to `Task01/first_collaboration.txt` (not `Task02/`) Respond to someones post by Sunday. The response should (i) be a new line item directly under the original post, (ii) should contain your name, and (iii) should engage with what the original respondent posted (length or a sentence/paragraph).

	```
	John Doe
	a. I decided to come to a public policy school because...
	b. I learned...
	c. Sally Johnson: I too came to a public policy school because...
	```

 You'll need to pull the latest version of the repository, update a file locally and then push the changes you need to make. 

## Things to keep in mind

- Note that the tricky part of the first task will be having so many of you working in the same file. Be sure not to overwrite each others work. Make sure all merge conflicts are dealt with. Though the input may seem trivial, collaborating through a single file on Github will not be. There is a high probability that you'll run into issues, try and resolve them using both the reading, lecture material, and the internet. 

## Aim

In this coding discussion, we will have done four things: (1) interacted and mutually collaborated on a mock project file, (2) downloaded a repository, edited it locally, and then pushed it back to the remote, (3) dealt with some basic version conflict errors, and (4) worked with a Jupyter notebook to run some code. 

Useful commands you'll want to keep in mind:

- `git add`: Stage local changes.
- `git commit -m "some message"`: commit local changes.
- `git fetch`: Pull the current state of the repository (data only)
- `git pull`: Pull the current state of the repository (automatically merges)
- `git push`: push your local version to Github.
